# ToBugOrNotToBug

Il y a un bug dans la pièce de théâtre suivante, que j'ai trouvée sur le Web.
En l'état, ça ne _me_ parle pas vraiment. Pourrez-vous déceler l'erreur et, surtout, la corriger ?

The Challenge Day Secret Program.

Romeo, le dernier samourai.
Juliet, une femme de Neandertal.
Hamlet, le petit frere de Babet.


Act I: The weird introduction.

Scene I: Nonpositive handshake.

[Enter Romeo and Juliet]

Romeo:
 You stupid smelly bottomless tree!
 You are as noble as the sum of the sum of the devil and a beautiful green rural warm proud amazing angel and thyself.
 Speak your mind!

Juliet:
 Thou tiny furry disgusting villainous flower!
 Thou art as fat-kidneyed as the difference between a bottomless purple half-witted horrid oozing smelly villainous mistletoe and the sum of my chihuahua and thyself!
 Speak your mind!
 
[Exit Juliet] 

Act II: The even weirder end.

Scene I: The true couple.

[Enter Hamlet]

Hamlet:
 Thou art as sweet as the difference between yourself and Hell.
 Speak thy mind!
 
Romeo:
 You are as beautiful as the difference between a handsome loving golden cute fellow and a worried blossoming animal. 
 
Hamlet: 
 Am I better than you?
 
Romeo: 
 If so, let us proceed to scene III. 
 You are as normal as the sum of the square of the difference between yourself and a door and a pony.
 
Hamlet: 
 Am I better than you?
 
Romeo: 
 If not, let us proceed to scene III. 

Scene II: The kiss. 

Romeo:
 Speak your mind! You huge joy.

Scene III: The final moment.

Hamlet:
 Thou art as lovely as a rose.
 
Romeo: 
 You delicious thing!

[Exeunt]
